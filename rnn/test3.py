'''Example script showing how to use a stateful LSTM model
and how its stateless counterpart performs.

More documentation about the Keras LSTM model can be found at
https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm

The models are trained on an input/output pair, where
the input is a generated uniformly distributed
random sequence of length = "input_len",
and the output is a moving average of the input with window length = "tsteps".
Both "input_len" and "tsteps" are defined in the "editable parameters" section.
A larger "tsteps" value means that the LSTM will need more memory
to figure out the input-output relationship.
This memory length is controlled by the "lahead" variable (more details below).
The rest of the parameters are:
- input_len: the length of the generated input sequence
- lahead: the input sequence length that the LSTM
  is trained on for each output point
- batch_size, epochs: same parameters as in the model.fit(...) function
When lahead > 1, the model input is preprocessed to a "rolling window view"
of the data, with the window length = "lahead".
This is similar to sklearn's "view_as_windows"
with "window_shape" being a single number
Ref: http://scikit-image.org/docs/0.10.x/api/skimage.util.html#view-as-windows
When lahead < tsteps, only the stateful LSTM converges because its
statefulness allows it to see beyond the capability that lahead
gave it to fit the n-point average. The stateless LSTM does not have
this capability, and hence is limited by its "lahead" parameter,
which is not sufficient to see the n-point average.
When lahead >= tsteps, both the stateful and stateless LSTM converge.
